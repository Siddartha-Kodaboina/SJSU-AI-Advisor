Some programs may allow you to take multiple specialization choice classes concurrently, while others may not.

In general, it's best to check with your academic advisor or the department that offers the specialization courses to determine the policies for taking multiple specialization choice classes in the same semester.

Some possible scenarios:

1. **Allowed:** You can take two or more specialization choice classes in the same semester if they are part of a combined course offering (e.g., a 3-credit course with an additional credit for a special topic) or if you have met the prerequisites and have the necessary resources.
2. **Not allowed:** Some programs may require you to choose only one specialization choice class per semester, or may limit the number of classes you can take in that area.
3. **Variable:** In some cases, the policy might depend on your level of study (e.g., undergraduate vs. graduate), the specific course requirements, or other factors.

To confirm, I recommend:

1. Checking with your academic advisor to discuss your options and any potential limitations.
2. Reviewing the program's course catalog and syllabi for each specialization choice class you're interested in taking.
3. Consulting with the department that offers the specialization courses if needed.

Remember to prioritize your academic responsibilities, ensure you meet all prerequisites and course requirements, and make informed decisions about your course selection.","No, you can only take one specialization choice class, which totals 3 units, in the same semester."

Many universities offer specialized courses or tracks within their degree programs, which may not be explicitly listed in the course catalog.

Here are some ways you can explore additional specialization options:

1. **Check with your academic advisor**: Reach out to your academic advisor to discuss potential classes or programs that align with your interests and career goals. They may have knowledge of hidden gems or upcoming courses that aren't yet listed.
2. **Look for online resources**: Websites like the university's course catalog, student website, or departmental website might provide information on non-listed courses or specializations.
3. **Consider electives from other departments**: While not a traditional specialization, taking elective courses from other departments can provide a broader perspective and complement your existing coursework.
4. **Search for interdisciplinary programs**: Many universities offer interdisciplinary programs that combine multiple fields of study. These might not be listed separately but still count as specializations within your degree program.

Before pursuing an unlisted specialization, consider the following:

* **Make sure it aligns with your goals**: Verify that the courses or programs you're interested in align with your career objectives and personal interests.
* **Check prerequisites and course availability**: Ensure that the courses you want to take are available at the time you need them and meet any necessary prerequisites.
* **Discuss with your advisor**: Share your ideas with your academic advisor to get their input and ensure that you're on the right track.

By taking these steps, you can explore additional specialization options beyond what's listed in the course catalog.","No, you must choose from the listed specialization choice classes. You can check the SJSU catalog for the list of available specialization choice classes."
Can AI students take SE courses?,"Yes, AI students can take SE courses, but please check with the department advisor for any enrollment restrictions or prerequisites.","In most cases, traditional human students are eligible to take courses, including those offered by the School of Engineering (SE), at a university. However, the policy regarding AI students taking SE courses can vary depending on several factors.

Some possible scenarios:

1. **Guest student status**: A university might allow an AI student to enroll as a guest student in certain SE courses, subject to specific conditions and requirements.
2. **Exceptional circumstances**: In rare cases, a university might grant permission for an AI student to take a course if it meets exceptional circumstances, such as the AI system's ability to contribute meaningfully to the class discussion or complete assignments.

However, there are also some arguments against AI students taking SE courses:

1. **Lack of human interaction**: AI systems lack human-like interactions and may not be able to engage in discussions or participate in group work in the same way as human students.
2. **Limited understanding**: AI systems might not have a deep understanding of the subject matter, which could impact their ability to complete assignments or participate in class discussions.

To determine whether an AI student can take SE courses, you would need to consult with the specific university's policies and procedures regarding guest students, exceptional circumstances, or other relevant guidelines.","No, AI students are not eligible to take SE courses. The MSAI program has its own set of required and optional courses."
