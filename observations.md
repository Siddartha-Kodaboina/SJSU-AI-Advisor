I don't have specific information on the exact course codes for a particular university's Master's 
in Artificial Intelligence (MS AI) program. Course offerings can vary significantly between 
institutions and may change over time.


However, I can provide some general insights into common core courses that are often included in MS 
AI graduate programs:

1. **Foundational Courses**
 * Introduction to Machine Learning (e.g., STAT 545 or CS 535)
 * Deep Learning (e.g., CS 545 or STAT 560)
 * Natural Language Processing (NLP) (e.g., CS 540 or STAT 550)

2. **Theory and Foundations**
 * Probability Theory (e.g., STAT 501 or CS 571)
 * Linear Algebra and Optimization (e.g., MATH 531 or CS 572)
 * Information Theory (e.g., STAT 561 or CS 573)

3. **Computer Vision and Robotics**
 * Computer Vision (e.g., CS 540 or STAT 550)
 * Robotics (e.g., CS 541 or ME 551)

4. **Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience**
 * Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) (e.g., CS 542 or HCI 561)
 * User Experience Design (e.g., CS 543 or HCI 562)

5. **Data Science and Analytics**
 * Data Mining (e.g., STAT 560 or CS 570)
 * Big Data Analytics (e.g., STAT 561 or CS 573)

6. **Machine Learning Engineering**
 * Machine Learning Engineering (e.g., CS 545 or STAT 560)
 * Model Deployment and Serving (e.g., CS 546 or STAT 561)

7. **Specialized Courses**
 * Reinforcement Learning (e.g., CS 550 or STAT 570)
 * Computer Vision for Robotics (e.g., CS 541 or ME 551)
 * Natural Language Processing for AI (e.g., CS 540 or STAT 550)
