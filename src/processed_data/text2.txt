**General Questions**


---|--- 
  * I am an international student and just got admitted, what courses should I take?
    * You should attend the New Student Orientation which is generally scheduled at the beginning of a semester. You will be notified by your program advisor via email, detailing the schedule and place of the meeting. Additionally, read about the program structure and advising recommendations on your program's website and message [your program advisor](/gape/connect/advisor-and-evaluator.php "Advisor and Evaluator") with any questions.

  * What is a Conditional Classification?
    * Conditional Classification refers to your admission standing at SJSU and means that you have not satisfied all the required conditions for admission. The GAPE office provides you a letter which specifies the conditions being placed on your admission. You are not allowed to take more than 12 units of graduate courses until the conditions are satisfied. After you have satisfied all of the required conditions, you will need to fill out a [Change of Classification in Graduate Program form [pdf]](https://www.sjsu.edu/me/docs/forms_gape-Change%20of%20Classificaton%20in%20Graduate%20Program%2003.17.16.pdf "Change of Classificiation Form") and submit to your [Graduate Program Advisor](/gape/connect/advisor-and-evaluator.php "Advisor and Evaluator") to change your status.

  * Do I need advising every semester in order to register for classes?
    * It depends on the program. Some programs place an advising hold that requires you to meet with your program advisor every term, while other programs require this meeting only from students who are on academic probation. Even if there is no hold on your account, it is recommended to meet with your program advisor at least once a semester to make sure you are on the right track to graduation.

A Culminating Experience Form is required by the university to show that you have met the necessary skills to obtain an MS degree. The form is processed by the graduate advisor after you have passed the Project or Thesis course successfully and your final report has been approved by your graduate committee.
