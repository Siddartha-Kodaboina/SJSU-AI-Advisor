# Masters of Science in Software Engineering

  * MSSE Highlights
    * The MSSE program, offered by the Department of Computer Engineering, provides students with an educational experience that builds on traditional computer science and engineering and takes an integrative approach to software engineering. The program integrates the forces shaping software development, including emerging technologies, with the understanding of rapidly changing technologies and architectures and their influence on software engineering processes, where large-scale design is pre-eminent, service and component integration is the standard mode of development, and there is increased globalization of the software development workforce.

The program offers specializations in Enterprise Software Technologies, Cloud
Computing and Virtualization, Software Systems Engineering, Data Science,
Cybersecurity and Networking Software.

Class schedules are designed for the convenience of employed engineers who
wish to pursue graduate work on a part-time basis.

The MSSE Program welcomes students with undergraduate degrees in other
engineering or science disciplines and that have strong programming skills.

  * Program Requirements
    * The [Masters of Science in Software Engineering program requirements](/cmpe/academic/ms-software-engineering/msse-program-requirements.php) include degree core, specialization classes, electives, and a culminating experience. 

The SJSU Davidson College of Engineering Extended Studies also provides off-
campus, cohort programs in Cloud/Mobile Computing, Data Science and
Cybersecurity. These programs confer a MS Software Engineering degree by
providing classes on a fixed schedule of evening classes. More information
about the Engineering Extended Studies programs can be found
[here](/ees/index.php).
