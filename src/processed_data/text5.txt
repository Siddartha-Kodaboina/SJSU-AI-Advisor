# Culminating Experience (6 units)

All students must complete one of the following culminating experiences
(thesis or project). Theses and projects are completed under the supervision
of an advisor.

## Masters Thesis (6 units)

A master’s thesis includes original research on a topic approved by the thesis
committee and must meet university requirements as stipulated in this catalog
and in the SJSU [Master’s Thesis and Doctoral Dissertation
Guidelines](/cgs/current-students/thesis-and-dissertations/index.php). It
undergoes a thorough review and revision process under the guidance of the
candidate’s thesis committee chair with the assistance of the thesis
committee.

  * CMPE 299B - Master's Thesis II (3 units)

## Masters Project (6 units)

A master’s project is a research or development effort performed by a student
individually on a topic chosen by mutual agreement between an advisor and the
student. The choice of project topic is also approved by the Graduate Advisor.
The individual student projects could be distinct components of a larger
integrated project performed by a team of students.
