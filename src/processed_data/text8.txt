# MSSE Program Requirements

# Students Admitted Prior to Fall 2020

Students admitted prior to Fall 2020 can continue to follow the course catalog
published prior to Fall 2020 and follow the [program
requirements](https://www.sjsu.edu/msse/msse-program-requirements-pre-
fall2020/).

# Program Changes

There are important program catalog changes for students admitted for Fall
2020 or later. In summary, the changes are:

  * Increase from 6 to 9 units for degree core classes.
  * New classes for the Data Science specialization. This change also affects the list of specialization choice classes for all other specializations.
  * Reduction from 9 to 6 units for elective classes.
  * Increase in total required units from 30 to 33 units for the MS Software Engineering degree by the requirement that all students take a GWAR (Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement) class.

Students that were admitted prior to Fall 2020 may choose to graduate using
the Fall 2020 catalog but they must meet all new requirements and cannot pick
a subset of the requirements.

# Course Work

Students earn a Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSSE) degree by
completing 33 semester units of graduate study, plus meeting a competency in
written English requirement. All students are required to complete 9 units of
degree core courses, 9 units of required specialization courses, 6 units of
elective courses, 3 unit GWAR class, and 6 units of master's project or thesis
to fulfill the 33 unit requirement. Details of these requirements are spelled
out below.

## Degree Core Courses (9 units)

Mining

## Required Specialization Courses (9 units)

Take two required specialization core classes from one of the six
specalizations **plus  **one specialization choice class from one of the other
five specializations. Visit the web page for each of the specializations for
details.

## Elective Courses (select 6 units)

All CMPE graduate courses (those with a course number of 200 or higher) except
CMPE 270, 271, 294, 298, 298I, 295A/B, and 299A/B can be used as elective
courses. This also includes specialization core classes from other
specializations and all experimental courses (CMPE 296A - CMPE 296Z).

**Note:**  Courses from other departments may be permitted with **prior
**advisor approval.

## Culminating Experience (choose one of the following)

**Masters Project  (6 units)**  
[CMPE 295A](http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/catalog/courses/CMPE295A.html)
Master's Project I  
[CMPE 295B ](http://info.sjsu.edu/web-
dbgen/catalog/courses/CMPE295B.html)Master's Project II

**Masters Thesis  (6 units)**  
[CMPE 299A](http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/catalog/courses/CMPE299A.html)
Master's Thesis I  
[CMPE 299B](http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/catalog/courses/CMPE299B.html)
Master's Thesis II

**Note 1:**  The degree core and specialization core must be completed before
beginning the Culminating Experience. It is advised that the specialization
choice and CMPE 294/ENGR 200W be completed before taking taking CMPE 295A or
CMPE 299A. However, only one of the two classes can be taken concurrently with
CMPE 295A or CMPE 299A, but NOT both and cannot be taken after CMPE 295A. All
degree core, specialization core, specialization choice, and CMPE 294/ENGR
200W classes must be completed before starting CMPE 295B.

## Competency in Written English

[CMPE 294 ](http://info.sjsu.edu/web-
dbgen/catalog/courses/CMPE294.html)Computer Engineering Seminar  
[ENGR 200W](http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/catalog/courses/ENGR200W.html)
Engineering Reports

**Note:**  All graduate students are required to complete a competency in
written English class as a requirement for graduation. The university catalog
specifies alternate ways for meeting the competency in written English
requirement (see the [catalog](http://catalog.sjsu.edu/) for details). If the
written English requirement is met by one of the methods prescribed in the
catalog, 3 units of additional elective units must be taken.

The Computer Engineering department requires that if a course must be taken to
meet the competency in written English requirement, that the course must be
CMPE 294 (preferred) or ENGR 200W.
