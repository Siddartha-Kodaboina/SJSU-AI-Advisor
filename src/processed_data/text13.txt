# Data Science

## Specialization Overview

The Data Science specialization prepares students and professionals to
investigate and summarize real-world data of all sizes, ask the right
questions, find informative answers, and create visualizations that
effectively communicate their results. Through a combination of theory and
practical data analysis, students learn the foundations of extracting
knowledge from data, verifying the utility of the information, and scaling
their analysis to Big Data. The program emphasizes teamwork throughout the
curriculum, as an essential part of preparing students for working in
industry.

The specialization focuses on a variety of techniques and methods for
analyzing data, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis,
unsupervised and supervised inference and learning, association analysis and
pattern mining, Web search, text mining, recommender systems, social network
and sentiment analysis, hypothesis testing, image recognition, time series
analysis, deep learning, and data visualization. Students learn and practice
the entire analytics process, from translating real-world objects into data to
presenting information gleaned from the analysis.
