# MSAI Admissions

Candidates must meet all university [admission
requirements](https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=2&navoid=101).
Applicants can be admitted in either classified or conditionally classified
standing. If an applicant’s preparation for advanced graduate work is
considered inadequate to meet the course prerequisites or other departmental
requirements, the conditions will include taking preparatory courses to meet
these requirements. These courses will not count as part of the master’s
degree program requirements.

For acceptance by the Department of Computer Engineering, the applicant must
satisfy the following requirements:

  * Undergraduate degree in math, physics, computer science, engineering, or a closely related field, equivalent to a four-year U.S. undergraduate baccalaureate degree, with demonstrated college-level courses in programming, data structures, algorithm design, three-semester sequence of calculus, linear algebra, and statistics.
  * Undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher.
  * If undergraduate program is not ABET-accredited, GRE is required with minimum GRE q+v of 305 and GRE AWA of 3.0. GRE q+v minimum higher than 305 may be required for successful admission depending on the number of applicants. 
    * GRE might be waived if the applicant holds a CS/CMPE or related degree from an accredited US institution, or a graduate (MS/PhD) degree in a STEM domain. This is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Please email [msai@sjsu.edu](mailto:msai@sjsu.edu) with your specifics.
  * International applicants must meet SJSU’s minimum requirements on [English-language proficiency tests](/admissions/graduate/admission-requirements/index.php).
